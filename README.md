# Voice-Assistant
 
1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION - A Voice assistant is a user interface that takes the voice commands from the user and does the corresponding task. The task might be responding to the queries, connecting to the device, and doing the work specified by the user like opening google, etc. Here, we will be mimicking such a system using Python.
So here, I had used multiple Python modules to build this voice assistant for doing different tasks like accessing files from the device, opening a browser, finding time, chatting, opening applications, playing music, etc. One of the main modules is the speech_recognition which is the heart of the whole project. Using this, we will be listening to the voice messages, decode them and also give vocal outputs. Other modules are also have been used based on the commands I have added to my assistant.

2. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED - Python
